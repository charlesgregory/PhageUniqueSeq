# PhageUniqueSeq
A java program to aid my research in finding unique primers for mycobacteriophages
This program is currently under development for my research on mycobacteriophages.
It is setup to be pulled into IntelliJ Idea using VCS.
The program's eventual design will be to create unique sequences of a certain size for
all mycobacteriophage clusters for the purpose of using these as biological
identifiers of cluster status.

The program has a simple gui and requires an internet connection. It also requires that
within the src/main/java/ there be a folder named "Common", "Fastas", "PhageData", and "Unique".
