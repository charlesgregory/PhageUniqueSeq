# PhageUniqueSeq

Mycobacteriophage Unique Sequence Finder

A java program to aid my research in finding unique primers for mycobacteriophages
This program is currently under development for my research on mycobacteriophages.
It is setup to be pulled into IntelliJ Idea using VCS.
The program's eventual design will be to create unique sequences of a certain size for
all mycobacteriophage clusters for the purpose of using these as biological
identifiers of cluster status.

The program has a simple gui and requires an internet connection. It can be compiled
into a .jar file using the included manifest. Phage and common analysis take a few
minutes to complete. Unique analysis however takes more time and is very CPU intensive.
I would recommend having a good CPU with good ventilation before attempting. I performed
these computations using a Dell Inspiron 15R-SE with an Intel i7 (8 cores after hyperthreading),
8 gbs of RAM, and a SSD.

This project was created at Western Kentucky University with the help of Dr. Claire Rinehart,
the WKU Bioinformatics and Information Science Center, and the WKU High Performance Computing
Center.
