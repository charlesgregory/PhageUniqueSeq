# PhageUniqueSeq
A java program to aid my research in finding unique primers for mycobacteriophages
This program is currently under development for my research on mycobacteriophages.
It is setup to be pulled into IntelliJ Idea using VCS.
The program's eventual design will be to create unique sequnces of a certain size for 
all myco bacteriophage clusters for the purpose of using these as biological 
identifiers of cluster status.
